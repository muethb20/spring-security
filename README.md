# Getting Started

This App app is made for task assignment and contains Features like :
1. Task Assignment
2. Task Viewing
3. Registration
4. Login
5. User Deletion
6. Task Completion

To start off with an admin User, you need to add in a Admin User.
This can be done by adding one into the ```user_roles``` table. Just change the role from ROLE_USER to ROLE_ADMIN.
